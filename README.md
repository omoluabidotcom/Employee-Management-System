# Employee-Management-System
This repository consists of Java Program for Employee Management System. In this repository I have created a TUI program for Employee Management System which consists of 4 different operation.<br>
(1) Add an Emloyee<br>  (2) Remove an Employee<br> (3) Update an Employee<br>  (4) View an Employee (5) View all Employees<br>

The Program is completely based on OOPs concept.

# How to run ?
For Compliation : <code>javac EmployManagementSystem.java</code>

To Run Program  : <code>java EmployManagementSystem</code>

NOTE: I only reviewed the code and added a feature (i.e a class Employee_All) to view all employeee details.
